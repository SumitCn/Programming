Note: indexing start from 0;
* Upper bound always return the index of first element which is greater than the element asked.
* Lower bound always return the index of first element which is not less than the asked element.

Eg. 
10 10 10 20 20 20

lowerbound(9) = 0
upperbound(9)=  1
upperbound(10)= 3
lowerbound(10)= 0

upperbound(20)= 6
upperbound(21) =6
Lower bound:
Now you can see lower bound for 9 and 10 is same so do check whether the ith element is equal to asked element or not.

Upperbound
There is a confusion in upper bound only when you search the highest element or element greater than highest element.
The index is array length , so check whether (i-1)th element is equal to asked element or not.
